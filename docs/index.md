Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, etc... The number of cryptocurrencies is apparently endless. In this tutorial we will cover the technologies that underly this new and burgeoning field. Concepts such as Blockchain, Proof of Work, SegWit, Merkle Trees, Smart Contracts, etc will be introduced and explained in detail to allow participants to better understand the pros and and cons of each cryptocurrency.

# Summary

[Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf), originally announced in 2009 by the enigmatic Satoshi Nakamoto has brought about a true revolution in the way in which we think about money. In one fell stroke it solved the main problems that had afflicted previous attempts at a truly digital currency: distributed consensus, double spending, and external attacks. 

Perhaps more importantly, it provided the first working version of a blockchain or a distributed ledger, a technology whose implications we are just now starting to explore and understand. Despite their relative simplicity, the underlying concepts on which these technologies are built are not well known and often obscured by hype and technical jargon. 

Since the days of Satoshi, many other crypto-currencies have been proposed and released. The most interesting and promising of which, [Ethereum](http://blockchainlab.com/pdf/Ethereum_white_paper-a_next_generation_smart_contract_and_decentralized_application_platform-vitalik-buterin.pdf) allows even for self enforcing [smart contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract) that constitute a distributed computational framework that may be used for the creation of decentralized applications by third party developers. 

In this tutorial we will introduce these technologies in a hands on fashion by building a small toy blockchain from scratch using standard Python. The main algorithms and concepts will be explained and implemented to give participants a thorough understanding of the way in which they operate. Recent developments and proposals such as [SegWit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SegWit), [Lightning Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Network) will also be covered.
